### Web-Enabled Desktop Application with WPF and MVC

This guide explains how to create a desktop application using WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation) that integrates a web application hosted in MVC (Model-View-Controller).

#### Prerequisites:

- Visual Studio
- `Microsoft.Web.WebView2` package for WPF

#### Steps:

1. **Create WPF Application**:
   - Start by creating a new WPF application project in Visual Studio.

2. **Install WebView2 Package**:
   - Install the `Microsoft.Web.WebView2` package in your WPF project. This package enables embedding a Chromium-based WebView control into your WPF application.

3. **Set up Communication**:
   - In your MVC project, add JavaScript code to send messages to the WPF application. This can be done in the layout page (`_layout.cshtml`) or any relevant JavaScript file. For example:

    ```javascript
    if (
        window.chrome &&
        window.chrome.webview &&
        window.chrome.webview.postMessage
    ) {
        window.clientAdapator = {
            processUICommand: (c, d) => {
                window.chrome.webview.postMessage(
                    JSON.stringify({ command: c, meta: d })
                );
            },
        };
    }
    ```

4. **Handle Messages in WPF**:
   - In your WPF application, handle the messages sent from the WebView control. This can be done by subscribing to the `WebMessageReceived` event. For example:

    ```csharp
    private void SystemWebView_WebMessageReceived(object sender, CoreWebView2WebMessageReceivedEventArgs e)
    {
        // Process the received message
        string message = e.TryGetWebMessageAsString();
        // Handle the message as needed
    }
    ```

5. **Run the Application**:
   - Build and run both your MVC and WPF projects. The WPF application will embed the MVC web application and communicate with it using the WebView control.

#### Benefits:

- **Web Integration**: Embeds a web application into a desktop environment, enabling access to web-based features and resources.
  
- **Desktop Functionality**: Provides access to desktop-specific features and resources, such as local file access or system notifications.
